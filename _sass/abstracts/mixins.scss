/* Screen sizes are divided into six groups 
  1. Mobile Potraits: (less than 640px)
  2. Mobile landscape: (more than or equal to 640px)
  3. Tablet portrait: (more than or equal to 768px)
  4. Tablet landscape: (more than or equal to 1024px) 
  5. Desktop: (more than or equal to 1280)
  6. Big Desktop: (more than or equal to 1800px)

  General guideline is to:
  - We don't support mobile screen widths less than 300px
  - Design for mobile first (there isn't a breakpoint defined for mobile potraits)
  - Customize design for bigger screen sizes using media queries
