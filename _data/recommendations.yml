  text: Will's passion and drive to do awesome stuff is truly unbounded. When he started working on HackTheMidlands, he really hit the ground running, and coordinated an incredible outreach scheme, as well as profoundly contributing to the organisation of the event as a whole.<br></br>His variety of skills - both technical and interpersonal - have allowed him to flourish over the past few years, and I'd highly recommend working with him to anyone!
